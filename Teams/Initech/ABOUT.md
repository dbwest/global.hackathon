We are coders from Columbus, OH. As a team, we’re collectively concerned with climate change and how it affects both our individual selves, our families, and the world.
Personally we each have something to say as well:
dbwest: It’s time that people can really get a handle on how they affect the world on a personal level. I have faith that these days people are concerned and want to make a difference. Helping them connect to how they impact the planet can influence their behavior for positive change.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
Don't reveal too much about your project, this is a competition but maybe
you can tell us the technologies, APIs you are going to use and what kind
of application you are going to build.

You can change your mind, that's ok. Just push an update here when you do.
